This codebase implement the system for planning and development of shaft prouction factory.

## Usage
After entering program you suppose to enter input and output part parameters.

Based on this parameters program create production chain, calulate required parameters and showing required equipment and cost.

Based on required equipment you should place it in grid, creating workshop layout.
Also you can allow to program do it by itself and get automatick acceptable result.

After all calculation program provide end result list with all calculated values.
Also program allows to save/load in any state of work, remembering all inputed values.

## Installing of project
1. Download archieve from [releases](https://github.com/kolyaka32/Shaft-production-planner/releases), unzip and run 'Planner.exe'!
2. You can build project by yourself, watch point 'Instalation for own use'.


## Instalation for own use (windows)
1. Install C++ compiler (such as [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/#installation));
2. Install [Make](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/make/3.81/make-3.81.exe/download);
3. Install [CMake](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmake.mirror/);
4. Download and install external [SFML library](https://github.com/SFML/SFML);
For build and install code by yourself: [download](https://github.com/SFML/SFML/releases/) source code, unzip to any folder and run comand line **as administrator**:
```bash
cd ./SFML-3.0.1
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ../
make
make install
```
5. (*Optional) Code editor [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (for better usage) (Recomended to use with plugins on c++ and cmake).
6. Compile project itself:
```bash
cd ./Shaft-production-planner
mkdir build
cmake --build ./build --config Release --target all --
```


## Instalation for own use (unux systems)
1. Check availability of compilers[g++], [make] and [cmake];
2. Install external library [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML)
(For Debian-like systems):
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```
